## Software Engineer, part-time musician, and a cloud enthusiast at heart  
🙋🏻‍♂️ Hi there!  

Welcome to my GitHub! I hope you can find something interesting here that will allow you to get to know me a little better. I 💙 **LOVE** getting involved in fun projects where I can show other people how passionate I am about creating scalable and innovative solutions.  

Here, you will find things that I have developed, including Websites, robust APIs, and some other cloud-focused projects.  

Some of the things I feel the proudest about are:  

- [My personal website](https://github.com/arnaldo10cisne/arnaldo10cisne.github.io): A professional portfolio showcasing my projects and certifications, built with React and TypeScript, and deployed with AWS services like S3, CloudFront, and Lambda.  
- [The card game "UNO!" made in Python](https://github.com/arnaldo10cisne/UNO-in-python-terminal)  
- [The "Marvel Guidebook," a website created to consume the MARVEL API](https://github.com/arnaldo10cisne/MARVEL_API_PROJECT)  

I specialize in:  

🔹 **Frontend Development**: Using React and TypeScript to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces.  
🔹 **Backend Development**: Designing robust APIs with Python-Django and Django REST Framework.  
🔹 **Cloud Solutions**: Leveraging AWS services like Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and CI/CD pipelines for scalable and efficient deployments.  
🔹 **Infrastructure as Code**: Implementing solutions with AWS CDK and Docker to streamline development and ensure consistency.  

Finally, if you like the things you see here and would like to contact me, either for 👨🏻‍💼Work or even 🙌🏻Friendship, feel free to follow me on my social media! You can also send me an email [through my website](https://www.arnaldocisneros.com/contact) 😊
